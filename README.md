# Friendly Skeleton Web

Friendly Skeleton Web is a minimal app for starting a JavaScript/Web project
with the Firebase Platform.

## Getting started

Run `npm install` to grab the dependencies.

Then `npm serve` to run a local version, and `npm deploy` to deploy to firebase
hosting.

## Developing

This app is designed to be as minimal as possible to get you up and running with
firebase. Everything is currently in `public/index.html`. We suggest blasting
that away and using the framework of your choice for development.
